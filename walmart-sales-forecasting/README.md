# 🛒 Walmart Store Sales Forecasting

### 📌 Project Overview
I developed a Machine Learning model to forecast weekly sales for 45 Walmart stores. The goal was to use historical data to optimize inventory management and reduce stockouts during critical holiday weeks.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python:** Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation.
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest Regressor).
* **Time Series Analysis:** Implementation of lag features, rolling windows, and seasonal decomposition.
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib and Seaborn for trend analysis.

### 📊 Key Results
* **Performance:** Achieved a final RMSE of **2,511**, significantly outperforming the statistical baseline (RMSE 2,766).
* **Impact:** Improved forecast accuracy by **~9.2%**, allowing for more precise inventory planning logic.
* **Optimization:** Implemented manual hyperparameter tuning to balance model complexity and overfitting.
